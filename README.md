Sites must deploy a Virtual Machine inside the security boundary of their institution with the following requirements: <br>
<b>Operating system requirement:</b> Centos 7.x
<p><b>Minimum resources required for the application:</b> 8 cores and 32GB RAM
<p><b>Resources for loading data:</b> The resources required to load the data are determined based on the attributes of the data (number of patients, metadata per patient, annotations, etc.) and the mechanism to load the data (CSV, RDS). <br>

  Examples:
  * If you are loading the small example datasets provided, such as 1000 patients from CDC NHANES and/or one chromosome from 1000 Genomes, then the minimum system requirements (8 vCPU, 32 GB ram) will be excessive. 

* Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital requires m5.4xlarge ec2 (16 vCPU, 64 GB ram) and HEAPSIZE=40,960 to load the following: 
  * Clinical data for 2.9 million patients, with 112,267 variables and 874,530,503 observed facts in total loaded from an RDBMS using SQLLoader. 
Using the CSV loader may result in more resources being needed. 
  * Genomic data for 4,000 patients, with the following annotation columns configured using the HPDS annotation pipeline to generate those annotations for 30,879,078 total variants.
    * Allele frequency in GNOMAD
    * Variant_severity from VEP
    * Variant_consequence from VEP


* If the resources required to load your data exceed the minimum system requirements, you can spin up an additional VM dedicated to loading the data. After you are finished loading the data, then that VM can be shut off. 
* Additionally if your dataset is sufficiently large that loading it would cause disruptions in query processing for your production environment, it is advised to use a separate environment to conduct loading.
* Since a precise calculation to determine the resources required for loading data takes a prohibitive effort, a trial and error approach is the most practical way to determine what the loading resource environment is for any set of data.


<b> PIC-SURE Installation</b><br>
Follow the directions for [PIC-SURE All-in-one](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-all-in-one "PIC-SURE All-in-one"), but use the "Create Institute Node" pipeline, instead of the "Initial Configuration Pipeline".
Each site should run as close to the same code as possible to ensure compatibility. To facilitate this, all sites should build out of the same overrides repository and the same release-control repository. This repository contains the database set-up to correctly configure the access rules. 
<br>GIC Institute repo: https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-gic-institution 
<br>GIC Release Control repo: https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-gic-institution-release-control
<br>The PIC-SURE installation takes on average one week of effort from a full time software developer or systems admin.
